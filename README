Decisive robot is a web application that makes your decisions for you when you are feeling indecisive.

Copyright 2012 Daniel Kinsman.

To build (using make) you must have coffescript installed.

Once built, run web.py (or use foreman start) and open a browser to http://localhost:5000/

For the twitter bot, you'll need python twitter tools (sudo easy_install twitter).

Enjoy.
