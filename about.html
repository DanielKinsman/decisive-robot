        <p class="answered">HELLO FRAGILE MEATBAGS, I AM DECISIVE ROBOT.
            LISTEN TO <a href="http://danielkinsman.wordpress.com">THE CREATOR</a> EXPLAIN MY PURPOSE.<p>
        <blockquote>
            <p>
                Life is full of decisions.
                <a href="/?question=Should I cook soup, burgers or pasta for dinner?">Should I cook soup, burgers or pasta for dinner?</a>
                <a href="/?question=Should I watch the avengers or spiderman tonight?">Should I watch the avengers or spiderman tonight?</a>
                In short, life is full of first world problems.
                I have created a first world answer: Decisive Robot.
            </p>
            <p>Let Decisive Robot take the burden of indecision away from you. Ask it your questions and get an immediate answer.</p>
            <p>
                Decisive Robot isn’t very smart, if you try asking it “What should I do with my life?” or
                “What is the flight speed of an unladen African swallow?” it won’t be able to make sense of it.
                Stick to either-or options such as
                "<a href="/?question=Should I go for a walk, eat a peach or just sleep in?">Should I go for a walk, eat a peach or just sleep in?</a>"
            </p>
            <p>
                The bot is also on twitter, where you can tweet your questions to it and it will answer.
                To make sure you see the responses either follow <a href="http://twitter.com/DecisiveRobot">@DecisiveRobot</a>
                or look at your connect tab on twitter. The bot should answer within 30 seconds.
